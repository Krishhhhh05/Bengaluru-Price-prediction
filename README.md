This project aims to predict property prices in Bengaluru based on a thoroughly cleaned dataset. The prediction model employs logistic regression, determined to be the best-fitting algorithm during the model training process.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project has undergone extensive cleaning to ensure accurate and reliable results. Features such as location, size, total square feet, bath, balcony, and other relevant factors contribute to the model's predictions.

Model Training
The logistic regression algorithm was selected as the most suitable for this prediction task after rigorous evaluation. The model has been trained on the cleaned dataset, learning the patterns and relationships between various features to make accurate price predictions.

Web Interface
The project includes a user-friendly web interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can interact with the model seamlessly through a visually appealing and intuitive interface. The interface allows users to input property details and receive instant predictions regarding the property's price in Bengaluru.

Deployment
The model is deployed using Flask, a lightweight web application framework. Flask provides a simple and efficient way to expose the prediction model to users via a web interface. The deployment ensures that the model is accessible to users, providing real-time predictions on property prices.

Input Property Details:

Users can input details such as location, size, total square feet, number of bathrooms, and balconies through the web interface.
